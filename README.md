![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hari696/hollypedia/master/src/assets/images/readme_logo.png "Title")

# Overview.

Basic idea of Hollypedia is to share information about movies on most of the major languages. You can also watch Trailers and Teasers of that particular movie.We are getting all movies details by using [The MovieDatabase API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api "Title"). Three different APIs are used for fetching data in different format. [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/ "Title") is used for designing and Axios npm package is used for API calls. Navigations are done using React Routes npm package.
