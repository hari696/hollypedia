# Hollypedia - React App for Movies Info.

![Alt text](../assets/images/readme_logo.png?raw=true "Title")

# Overview.

Basic idea of Hollypedia is to share information about movies on most of the major languages. We are getting all movies details by using The MovieDatabase API (link). Three different APIs are used for fetching data in different format. Material UI is used for designing and Axios npm package is used for API calls. React Routes package is implmented.
